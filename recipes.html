               </p><br><br><br><br><br>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (2 1/2-3 lb) broiler-fryer chickens, cut up buttermilk, enough to cover the bird</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce butter flavor shortening (for frying)</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat to about 370º. (No thermometer needed, really. It'll get hot enough while chicken rests AFTER coating if you have your flame on about medium.) If it starts to smoke, turn it down immediately a bit.</li>
                <li>In a doubled brown paper lunch sack, mix together all of the dry ingredients.</li>
                <li>Shake off excess; place on waxed paper for 15 minutes or until dry. Brown until golden on bottom (good)(skin) side. When chicken pieces are golden on one side, turn pieces over, cover with tight fitting lid, and reduce heat to a simmer, turning chicken pieces ocaisionally, for 35 to 40 minutes or until juices run clear and chicken is tender. *When lid is placed on, and heat is reduced to a good simmer, the good side of pieces are the top sides. After about 10 minutes, turn back to skin-side down. After another 10 minutes or so, turn back to skin-side up for the last 10-15 minutes.).</li>
